<p>Counting with a local variable.</p>
<p>The underlying principle is: avoid global variables, as they are available
<br>to the entire scope of the containing window and may be
changed by another piece of code in the same window.</p>

<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Count!</button>
<p id="demo">0</p>

<p>A closure is a function that has access to the parent scope,
<br>even after the parent function has closed.
<p>Use only when really necessary as the code is a bit obscure to read.</p>
<p>The way it works:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The self-invoking function runs only once.
    <br>It sets the counter to zero (0), and returns a function expression.</li>
  <li>This way add becomes a function. The "wonderful" part is that it
    <br>can access the counter in the parent scope.</li>
  <li>This is called a JavaScript closure. It makes it possible for a function
    <br>to have "private" variables.</li>
  <li>The counter is protected by the scope of the anonymous function,
    <br>and can only be changed using the add function.</li>
</ul>

function myFunction(){
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = add();
